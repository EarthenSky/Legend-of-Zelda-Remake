'''In this file the user will be able to set if the game is full screen or not,
assign which keys do what (maybe even use a controller?), and are told a small bit about how to play.
After the user is fine with the settings, they press a button and are put into a menu area that is
similar to the original loz but easier to use. SEE _ for the menu script.'''
