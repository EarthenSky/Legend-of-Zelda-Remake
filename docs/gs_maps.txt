The maps used to sometimes draw tile and used for collision and interaction are stuctured like so:

( 45 67 12 8* )

Each item is separated with a space.

The first number represents the group while the second number represents the item in the group.

A star (*) means that the group is an animation and the animation will be played.

A newline means that the next item is on the next row down.
