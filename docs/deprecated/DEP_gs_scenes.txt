Info:
Scenes deal with object management and, object updating, and object drawing.
Any objects that you have in the game have to be part of a scene.  Except Link, the main char is the exception.
Scenes have a draw method and an update method which are called by the gameloop file if the scene is active.

There is a scene for the overworld, dungeon1, shop1, etc...


Notes:
- Have a function called when the scene is activated?  Probably, I can make a function in the gameloop or make a scene_manager class.
  I'll probably make a scene_manager that manages the scenes and will trigger the active function of each when a scene is set active.


Extras:
See the template at "test/gs/scene_template" to implement a scene.
